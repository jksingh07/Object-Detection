# Object-Detection

This project was built to help visually impaired people because it can serve as artificial eyes for them, It can detect and recognize the objects in front of it than by using a text to speech module it generates sound and let the person hear it.   we built a working prototype of a spectacle frame for blind people to aid them to recognize household items. The objective of the project was to build a prototype free of any external wiring and thus, the algorithm needed to be processed on a Raspberry Pi module powered by a power bank. To execute this project, we created a custom dataset and code various algorithms while also testing their performance on the Raspberry Pi module.
